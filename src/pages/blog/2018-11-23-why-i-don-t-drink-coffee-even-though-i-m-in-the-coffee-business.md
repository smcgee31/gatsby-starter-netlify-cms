When I was just a boy, I was rushed to the hospital with a torn hernia. It seems that I was born with this flaw in the muscle wall of my lower abdomen and something I did while playing finally tore it free. I don't really remember most details but I do remember that I was told that for the rest of my life I would need to be cautious of two things:

1. Beverages that were too hot.
2. Caffeine levels in my food and drink

These two things have limited my taste for coffee. I've never learned to like it since, being quite bitter naturally, it is usually an acquired taste and I just didn't "go there" when I grew to an age when all my friends, co-workers, and, well, everybody started drinking it. \
I've not missed it, I love the way it smells but since I don't care for the taste and shouldn't have it anyway, well, it's not a big deal. 

#### But it is big business! And I'm all in.

PS. This just in... apparently drinking coffee or other hot beverages and my caffeine intake have nothing to do with a hernia! Who knew?
